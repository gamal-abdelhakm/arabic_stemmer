This code snippet implements an Arabic stemmer, which is a linguistic tool used to reduce Arabic words to their root form or stem. The stem represents the core meaning of the word, and by stemming words, it becomes possible to analyze them more effectively.

The code defines a class called `Arabic_Stemmer`, which contains several methods for stemming Arabic words. The class initializes with a list of prefixes, suffixes, patterns, and a mapping dictionary. These components are used in the stemming process.

The `remove_diacritics` method utilizes regular expressions to remove diacritics from Arabic words, ensuring that the stemming process focuses on the basic word structure.

The `remove_prefix` and `remove_suffix` methods remove prefixes and suffixes from the given word, respectively. They iterate through the list of prefixes or suffixes and remove them if they are present at the beginning or end of the word.

The `pattern_encoder` method encodes a word based on a predefined mapping dictionary. It replaces Arabic letters with corresponding numerical values to create a pattern representation of the word. The method also handles special cases related to the mapping.

The `match_pattern` method compares the encoded pattern of a word with a list of encoded patterns. It checks if the word's pattern matches any of the predefined patterns, considering the possibility of some positions being zero.

The `stem` method is the main function that performs the stemming process. It starts by removing diacritics from the input word. Then, it checks if the encoded pattern of the word matches any of the encoded patterns defined in the class. If there is a match, the word is considered stemmed and returned as is.

If the word doesn't match any of the patterns, the method enters a loop where it tries to remove suffixes and prefixes iteratively. It keeps track of the previous word to avoid an infinite loop. If a match is found at any point, the stemmed word is returned.

After defining the `Arabic_Stemmer` class, the code imports the necessary modules (`re` and `pandas`) and creates an instance of the `Arabic_Stemmer` class called `stemmer`.

A list of Arabic words is provided in the `words` variable. The code then iterates through each word, applies the stemming process using the `stem` method of the `stemmer` object, and stores the stemmed words in a new list called `stemmed_words`.

Finally, the code creates a pandas DataFrame to display the original words and their corresponding stemmed words in a tabular format. The DataFrame is printed to the console using the `print` function.

This code showcases your ability to implement a language-specific tool (an Arabic stemmer) using Python and demonstrates your proficiency in working with string manipulation, regular expressions, and data manipulation with pandas.
